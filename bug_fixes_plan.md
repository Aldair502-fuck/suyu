# Suyu Bug Fixes Plan

## 1. Game-specific issues

### Approach:
- Analyze logs and crash reports for the affected games (e.g., Echoes of Wisdom, Tears of the Kingdom, Shin Megami Tensei V).
- Identify common patterns or specific hardware/API calls causing issues.
- Implement game-specific workarounds if necessary.

### TODO:
- [ ] Review game-specific issues in the issue tracker
- [ ] Analyze logs and crash reports
- [ ] Implement fixes for each game
- [ ] Test fixes thoroughly

## 2. Crashes

### Approach:
- Implement better error handling and logging throughout the codebase.
- Add more robust null checks and boundary checks.
- Review and optimize memory management.

### TODO:
- [ ] Implement a centralized error handling system
- [ ] Add more detailed logging for crash-prone areas
- [ ] Review and improve memory management in core emulation components

## 3. Shader caching and performance issues

### Approach:
- Optimize shader compilation process.
- Implement background shader compilation to reduce stuttering.
- Review and optimize the caching mechanism.

### TODO:
- [ ] Profile shader compilation and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement asynchronous shader compilation
- [ ] Optimize shader cache storage and retrieval
- [ ] Implement shader pre-caching for known games

## 4. Missing features

### Approach:
- Prioritize missing features based on user demand and technical feasibility.
- Implement support for additional file formats (NSZ, XCZ).
- Add custom save data folder selection.

### TODO:
- [ ] Implement NSZ and XCZ file format support
- [ ] Add UI option for custom save data folder selection
- [ ] Update relevant documentation

## 5. Add-ons and mods issues

### Approach:
- Review the current implementation of add-ons and mods support.
- Implement a more robust system for managing and applying mods.
- Improve compatibility checks for mods.

### TODO:
- [ ] Review and refactor the current mod system
- [ ] Implement better mod management UI
- [ ] Add compatibility checks for mods
- [ ] Improve documentation for mod creators

## 6. General optimization

### Approach:
- Profile the emulator to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Optimize core emulation components.
- Implement multi-threading where appropriate.

### TODO:
- [ ] Conduct thorough profiling of the emulator
- [ ] Optimize CPU-intensive operations
- [ ] Implement or improve multi-threading in suitable components
- [ ] Review and optimize memory usage

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- Implement a comprehensive test suite for core emulation components.
- Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically.
- Establish a structured QA process for testing game compatibility and performance.

Remember to update the relevant documentation and changelog after implementing these fixes. Prioritize the issues based on their impact on user experience and the number of affected users.
